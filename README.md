WALS Language Data Visualization

The project uses a web page to map all the data from the WALS Language Database onto both a 2-dimension chart and a geographical world map. When user hovers on one of the language point on either chart/map, s/he can observe the other chart/map to see the relation between its selected value and its geographical position.

The data is hosted online, so there's no specific requirement to get the data. The data is downloadable at http://iv.tale.land/data/data.xlsx
